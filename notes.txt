1. For development purpose, the node server can be start from the local machine instead of within docker container.  Use ./serve.sh to do that.

But on Mac machine, hyperledge only support node 6 not 7/8.  Use 5. SetupNode.sh to change that.

Plese refer to:

One way to do is to clean up the code completely to delete hyperledger.

To build in development environment:
npm install -g n
sudo n 6.10.0
...
npm install -g composer-cli (might be some)

./serve.sh

After that, you can use "node index.js"

2. Find dependency: npm list
clean up packages not in package.json: npm prune
